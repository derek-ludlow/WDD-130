            Extra info (rough draft still)
            Review websites are platforms where consumers find reviews of products and services they might buy. However, that‘s not all. Review websites are increasingly becoming important for businesses as marketing tools. 
            Gaining enough good online reviews is now important for most businesses. Whether a restaurant or a software development company, these businesses are trying to get as many 5-star reviews as possible. What’s even more important is that they prefer these reviews to reflect on reputed review websites.
            Review websites enable transparency, and consumers love it. Consumers can post their reviews and give a star rating. Businesses need to acknowledge, take appropriate actions, and respond promptly to the reviews.
